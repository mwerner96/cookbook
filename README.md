# 📔 Cookbook
Foodblogs sometimes have nice recipes. However, they are frustrating to look at - inconsistent formatting, unnecessarily long primers and sometimes no concise way to print the recipes without printing 50% ads. Therefore, this private cookbook based on the LaTeX package [`cuisine`](https://ctan.org/pkg/cuisine) was created.

This cookbook is currently only available in german.

## 🍝 Recipes
Recipes are taken from all over the internet. Each menu has its own section with the required subrecipes.
